What is reproducible finance? 

*Reproducible Finance* is a philosophy for how to do build a data science practice in the world of finance. The world of finance is changing, embracing data science and technology, but there's no road map for how to do that.

R code is important, and the bulk of this book is dedicated to writing that R code. However, the reason this book is not called *R Code in Finance* is that I will frequently emphasize reproducibility, reusability, lean processes, experimentation and other best practices that relate to but go beyond writing code.

By book's end, an analyst or aspiring analyst at a bank or hedge fund will have the technical foundation to begin building a data science practice that delivers an advantage over slower moving firms. Readers will gain an edge on the competition through the use of data science.

Reproducible finance is doing data science the right way in the financial world. 

It consists of 4 pillars. 

Technology is the 1st pillar and that will be the primary focus of this book. By technology, I mean the R code and algorithms that are used to run tests and calculations, build visualizations, and assist humans in making decisions.  Are there other technologies besides R code? Yes, but this book is not about those.

Humans are the second pillar. By humans, I primarily mean the team, including the leaders and recruiters of the team, that are using the technology to gather and clean data, build models, test hypotheses and deliver actionable results to the rest of a financial instiution.  


Why is reproducible finance important?

What is covered in this book? 
- returns, risk, kurt, portfolio theory
- lots of visualizations
- redundancy
- shiny

A word on how things are weighted. You might notice a heavy emphasis on step 1, what probably seems the simplest step. Afterall, why waste our valuable time thinking about importing data, then wrangling it. Why not zip through that as fast possible and get to our risk management or portfolio construction as quickly as possible! 
1) If our team selves can't get the data into the right format, or see it in its raw state and how we go wrangled into our usable data, they can't evaluate our work or reproduce it. 
2) that time investement will pay off and make us more efficeient in the future in a few ways. first, it will ensure we have 'grokked' our data. love it or hate it, if you painstakingly document and make explicit your steps fromd data import to wrangle to transformation, you will know your data better than anyone else on the planet. And that raises the probability that your team will unearth creative insights or algorithms. Two, when you do unearth those algorithms, coding them up will be much faster if you know your data structures backwards and forwards. If that stuff is second nature, your team can spend more time on the alpha generating stuff. 

What is not covered in this book? 

The goal of this book is to demonstrate several, reproducible methods for calculating and visualizing the substance. We will not delve into the math that underlies the substance or delve deep into the portfolio theory. That stuff is important and highly recommended (and fascinating!). For readers who want to explore those concepts, I recommend Eric Zivot's "Financial Analytics with R" (see if you can port his code over to one of our methods). 


We also won't delve deep into the R programming language. Garret Grolemund and Hadley's Wickham's "R for Data Science" is ~~the Bible~~ a phenomenol source for that material.

Shiny? 
Shiny is an R package that wraps R code into an interactive web application.   

Shiny applications are extremely useful for sharing our work with end users who might not want to read code, or open an IDE, or dig into analytics.  For example, a portfolio manager might want to build a portfolio and see how a dollar would have grown in that portfolio, but he or she might not want to see the code, data and functions used for the calculation.  We will  embed our code and make explicit where our data came from, in case an end user does want to dig in or in case a colleague (including our future selves) want to reproduce/reuse our work. But we will also give consideration to the aesthetics and usability of our applications.

This book is not a guide on building Shiny apps but we will cover the basics and, more importantly, we will build several live, functioning Shiny applications. Similar to the rest of the R code in this book, we aim to build useful, reproducible Shiny apps but if your goal is to become an expert in Shiny, please start with shiny.rstudio.com or dedicated Shiny training.  

That said, by the end of this book, we will have covered enough financial Shiny apps for the reader to be an intermediate app developer in the realm of portfolio management. Because our apps will emphasize reproducibility, you can take the foundation here and use it for more complex apps.

Shiny applications are web-based so you will need to head to www.reproduciblefinance.com/shiny to view and interact with them live. All of the applications built in this book are accessible there, along with their source code.
